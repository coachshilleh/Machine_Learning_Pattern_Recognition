# Machine_Learning_Pattern_Recognition

# This is all of the code with regards to the Pattern Recognition course I took at Texas A&M where I learned many ML techniques like PCA, LDA, KNN, Eigenfaces, Feature Selection (FFS, BFS), Cross Validation, Quadratic LDA, Gaussian Kernel, Quadratic Classifiers, Linear Regression, and a few other things :)
